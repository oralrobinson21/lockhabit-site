<h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
<p class="muted">Pre-launch informational site only. Features and availability subject to change.</p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ul>
<li>LockHabit is a financial technology company, not a bank.</li>
<li>Banking and custody services are provided by regulated partner banks.</li>
<li>Deposits may be eligible for FDIC insurance up to legal limits per depositor, per bank.</li>
<li>Hard lock: no early withdrawal except approved emergencies; early break attempts incur a 5% fee.</li>
<li>Emergency access is a self-loan (approx. 5% APR) reported to credit bureaus. On-time payments may help credit; missed payments may harm it.</li>
<li>APR (currently 3% on locked balances) is prorated and may change with notice.</li>
