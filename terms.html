    <p class="note">LockHabit is a financial technology company, not a bank. Banking services and deposit custody are provided by regulated partner banks. When structured for pass-through coverage, balances may be eligible for FDIC insurance up to legal limits per depositor, per bank.</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By joining the waitlist, creating an account, using the simulator or opening a LockHabit account when available (collectively, the “Services”), you agree to these Terms and any policies referenced here. If you do not agree, do not use the Services.</p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>At least 18 years old and legally capable of entering a binding agreement.</li>
      <li>U.S. resident with a valid SSN/ITIN (for production account opening).</li>
      <li>Pass any required identity, sanctions and fraud checks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Savings “Lock” Accounts</h2>
    <p>LockHabit provides a behavioral “hard-lock” savings mechanism. You choose a term and optionally set up recurring contributions. Funds are reserved for you and <b>not</b> lent to others by LockHabit.</p>
    <h3>3.1 Lock Terms & APR Tiers</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>APR Tiers (illustrative, subject to change):</b> 1–3 months: 1.5–2.0% APR; 4–6 months: 2.5–3.0% APR; 6–12+ months: 3.25–3.5% APR.</li>
      <li>APR is prorated based on time in lock. Rates may change with notice; final APY and disclosures will be shown at account opening.</li>
      <li><b>Auto-Upgrade:</b> If you extend your lock to a higher tier, the new APR takes effect on the next cycle date (or within 14 days), and continues while the new term is active.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>3.2 Early Withdrawal Policy</h3>
    <p>Locks are intended to be held to maturity. Non-emergency early withdrawals incur a fee to discourage impulsive breaks and protect program stability:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Standard early-break fee: <b>5–10%</b> of the amount withdrawn (final schedule disclosed at account opening).</li>
      <li><b>Relock Grace:</b> If you relock the withdrawn amount within 48 hours, LockHabit may reduce the early-break fee by up to 50% (promotional/eligibility rules apply).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Self-Backed Loans</h2>
    <p>Borrowing is secured by your locked balance and designed to help you avoid early-break fees.</p>
    <h3>4.1 Standard Self-Loan</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Maximum loan amount: up to <b>75–80%</b> of current eligible balance.</li>
      <li>APR: typically <b>6–8%</b> (subject to change), <b>credited back to your lock</b> after full payoff.</li>
      <li>Payment reporting: intended to be reported to major bureaus; on-time payments may help build credit; late/missed payments may harm credit.</li>
      <li>Two (2) <b>skip-a-payment</b> options per 12-month period, which extend the loan term by one month each. Interest continues to accrue during skipped months.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>4.2 Emergency Loan (EAP)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Eligibility: verified hardship (e.g., job loss, medical, disaster). Documentation may be required.</li>
      <li>Amount: up to <b>90%</b> of eligible balance. Intro APR: <b>0%</b> for <b>3–6 months</b> (term varies on qualification).</li>
      <li>After the intro term, standard program APR may apply to any unpaid principal.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>4.3 APR During Outstanding Loans</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>While a self-loan is outstanding, the APR on the <i>remaining locked funds</i> may be reduced to <b>1–1.5%</b> until the loan is brought current or repaid.</li>
      <li>When the loan is current for 2 consecutive cycles or fully repaid, the lock APR may return to the applicable tier.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Fees</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Unlock fee at maturity:</b> flat $3 / $2 / $1 (by term) or as disclosed at account opening.</li>
      <li><b>Non-emergency early break:</b> 5–10% of withdrawn amount.</li>
      <li><b>Program/premium tier (optional):</b> $5–$7.99/mo includes benefits such as lower fees, faster EAP decisions, higher loan limits, or rate boosters (details disclosed at enrollment).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Disclosures & Risk</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>APRs and fees can change with notice. Some features may require partner bank participation and regulatory approvals.</li>
      <li>High-risk investment simulations (e.g., ETF at 15%) shown in demo are <b>illustrative only</b> and not investment advice. You may lose money.</li>
      <li>All loans are subject to approval and verification.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Communications & E-Sign</h2>
    <p>By using the Services you consent to receive electronic communications and disclosures. You may withdraw consent by contacting <a href="mailto:lockhabit@outlook.com">lockhabit@outlook.com</a>, which could impact your ability to use the Services.</p>

    <h2>8. Privacy</h2>
    <p>Your privacy is important. See our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details on data collection and usage.</p>
